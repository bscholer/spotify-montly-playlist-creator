# Spotify Tools ðŸ¤–

A collection of tools for automating Spotify playlist tasks

## Period Playlists

Period playlists are playlists that are created on a regular basis, and are populated with songs from your liked
songs. You can then specify how often new playlists are created, and how many songs are added to the playlist. 

Period options are:

* `daily`
* `weekly`
* `monthly`
* `yearly`

Playlist names can be customized with [`{date injections}`](/example/#date-injections) and an [`|alliteration|`](#alliterations), resulting in depressing names like "22 Anxious April".

The aim is to allow as much customization as possible, so you can **specify the playlist name**, **description**, **date key**, and even the **alliteration word list**.
